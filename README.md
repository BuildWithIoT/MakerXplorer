Automatic Door Bell Sensor

A smart doorbell system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect proximity and triggers a buzzer and LED. This project simulates the functionality of light-dependent resistors (LDRs) and thermistors, making it an ideal educational project for beginners in electronics and Arduino.

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates:

The working of ultrasonic sensors for proximity detection.
Using Tinkercad for designing and simulating electronic circuits.
Basics of Arduino programming to control hardware components.

How It Works:

The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of an object.
If the object is within 50 cm, the buzzer and LED are activated for 1 second.
Distance readings are displayed on the Serial Monitor for debugging.
